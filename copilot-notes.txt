Copilot Notes for Angular & TypeScript/JavaScript
**************************************************

- CoPilot wasn't able to determine types used in a service
e.g. in the single-resources component

    // forcing TS to treat this empty object as a ResourceModel type
    @Output() fromResourcesData: ResourceModel = {} as ResourceModel;

it was not able to determine the type of 'fromResourcesData'
It tried to force it to be 

    @Output() fromResourcesData: ResourceModel[] = [];
