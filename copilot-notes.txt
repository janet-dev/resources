Copilot Notes for Angular & TypeScript/JavaScript
**************************************************

- CoPilot wasn't able to determine types used in a service
e.g. in the single-resources component

    // forcing TS to treat this empty object as a ResourceModel type
    @Output() fromResourcesData: ResourceModel = {} as ResourceModel;

it was not able to determine the type of 'fromResourcesData'
It tried to force it to be 

    @Output() fromResourcesData: ResourceModel[] = [];

- Struggled with new features in Angular 17 e.g. control flow

Q: convert *ngIf to Angular 17 new control flow

A: In Angular 13 and later versions, the *ngIf directive can be replaced with the *ngIf 
as syntax for better readability and control flow. 
However, as of Angular 17, there's no new control flow introduced to replace *ngIf.
